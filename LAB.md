# Fullstack App

This is the repo for submitting your frontend. You are free to make up your own app, but as a 
standard, you can do image gallery.

* Use Redux for state management

## Image Gallery

There are multiple ways to implement, but generally:

* `album` Shows a list of album
* `add album` Add a new album
* `album detail` Shows album detail plus images for the album
    * `views` Provide different views of images
    * `add image` Add an image to the album
* `images` Show all images across album
* BONUS: `edit` and `delete` for `album` and `images`
